<h1>The All Time Best Movies</h1>
<h2>(According to Julie)</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Julie & Julia</h3>
<p>Meryl streep and French food, need I say more?</p>

<h3>Ocean's 8</h3>
<p>Sandy Bullock and a bunch of other cool ladies (aka Rihanna) steal jewelry from the Met Gala.</p>

<h3>The Holiday</h3>
<p>The perfect Christmas movie that you can actually watch all year round because Jude Law is so incredibly hot that the movie feels like summer anyway.</p>
